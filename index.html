I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most grueling - time of my life. since completing the course, i've successfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer at a VR startup.   "

                        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. i needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step , i was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long from assistance.The agile team project , in particular, was outstanding. it took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. in fact , i've often reffered to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. it certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
